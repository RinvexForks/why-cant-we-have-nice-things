Hi internals!

I'd like to propose an RFC, which allows the use of exceptions within the
engine and also allows changing existing fatal errors to exceptions:

https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions

This topic has been cropping up in the discussions for several of the
recent RFCs and I think the time has come to consider moving away from
fatal errors.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Nikita
